Polymerisation of a large number of monosaccharides form a polysaccharide
molecule. Hydrolysis of Polysaccharide results relevant monosaccharides.
Insoluble in normal water. They are not crystals. Cellulose, starch and glycogen
are examples for polysaccharides. The structural unit of cellulose, starch and
glycogen is glucose , but their properties are different according to the number of
glucose molecules and how they are bound with each other
