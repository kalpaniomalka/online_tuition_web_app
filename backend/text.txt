Recrystallization is used to separate pure substances from solid, crystalline
substances carrying impurities. The process of dissolving a solid, crystalline
substance and turning it again into crystals is called recrystallization. Crystals of
high quality without impurities can be obtained by recrystallization.
In recrystallization, the impure solid is dissolved in the hot solvent till it becomes
saturated. Afterwards, to separate the impurities in the impure solid, above solution
is filtered while it is still hot. Pure crystals of the solid is obtained by cooling the
filtrate. Here, crystallization occurs because the cold solution is saturated with the
solute although the hot solution is not. The soluble components present as impurities
in minor quantities are not crystallized as the solution is not saturated in them.
