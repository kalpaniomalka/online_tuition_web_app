The special proteins (organic catalysts) that are produced within the organism to
increase the rate of bio- chemical reactions are known as enzymes.
 For example to convert sucrose into Glucose, sucrose has to be heated with a
dilute acid. But the enzymes present in the digestive system do the same reaction
at a low temperature.
