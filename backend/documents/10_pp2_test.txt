Your story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of college after the first 6 months, but then stayed around. Is a drop in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why should I Dropout? It started? Before I was born. My biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption. You felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates. So everything was all set for me to be adopted at Birth by a lawyer and his wife, accept it. When I popped out, they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents who are on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night. Asking we got an unexpected baby boy. Do you want him? They said, of course, my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college.
