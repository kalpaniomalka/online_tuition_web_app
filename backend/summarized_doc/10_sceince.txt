Terrestrial plants obtain water from soil for photosynthesis. Water in the soil is
absorbed through root hairs by osmosis. The absorbed water then travels into
root xylem through cortex and endodermis. From there water is transported into
mesophyll cells of leaves via the xylem of stem and the veins of leaves. The network
of veins in the leaves distribute water throughout the leaf.
