I dropped out of college after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop in for another 18 months or so. My biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption. My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and if my father had never graduated from high school, she refused to sign the final adoption papers. The only relented, a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college, this was the start in my life. And all of my working-class parentâ€™s savings were being spent on my college tuition. I have no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how College was going to help me figure it out.
