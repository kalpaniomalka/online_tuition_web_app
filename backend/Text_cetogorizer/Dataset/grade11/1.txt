Take about 500 ml of water into a beaker. Add about
10g of clayey soil to it, stir well and allow to stand still for
about one minute. Then filter the muddy coloured water
into another beaker using a piece of cloth. Allow to stand
still for about an hour and see whether the muddy colour
is uniformly distributed throughout the solution. See if the
clearness of the solution is similar from top to bottom
