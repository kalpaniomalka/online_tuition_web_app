Do you know anyone who's a lifer have you heard this expression lifer? Let's 
listen to a couple of examples, and then we'll talk about what this slang .

expression .
 Means.
 If you don't study hard, you'll end up a lifer at McDonald's.
 I think Jim is going to be a lifer.
 He has zero ambition to do anything new, or you able to guess 
what life remains from the examples, as somebody who stays at the same job .

for the whole life .
 And we particularly use this expression to describe people who work in dead-end, 
jobs  So jobs that are minimum wage or undesirable jobs that have no opportunities 
for career advancement  So life for somebody in a dead-end job that will stay there for 
the whole life  Hope you learned something new today.
