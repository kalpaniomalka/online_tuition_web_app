This is used to express the composition of a homogeneous mixture (solution). 'Mole'
is the international unit for the amount of matter. Here, the composition is given in
terms of the amount of moles of solute contained in unit volume of a solution. The
composition expressed in this way is called the concentration (C). In chemistry,
very often concentration of a solution is expressed in terms of the amount of moles
of solute contained in a cubic decimetre of the solution
